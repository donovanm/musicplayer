		<h1>Music Player Example</h1>
		<p>This is just an example of dynamically tying a user interface to a background music player that's already playing music. I used this technique on a site that required background music playing in a single page app while allowing users to pull up the UI in its own view when necessary.</p>
		<p>I'm currently refactoring this into an easy-to-use music player library. Creating a playlist will be a cinch and the interface will be easy to customize the look of the player with CSS.</p>

		<div id="mp2" class="music-player inline light-playlist"></div>
		<div id="mp3" class="music-player inline embossed light-info"></div>
		<div id="mp4" class="music-player inline clear-info dark-playlist"></div>
